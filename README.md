# Invictus
A Discord based roguelike/RPG that incorporates both a lightweight Client application as well as a more heavy server to be run on a host machine that will also interface with a Discord bot on the game's Discord server for Discord integration.

## Motivation
I have always been interested in creating games, and have recently made several Discord.py Discord bots. Why not mesh the two?

## Description
Invictus is a text/UI based roguelike/RPG that takes each player on an adventure unlike any other, with a deep lore awaiting those who wish to seek it out, and a MMO-like collaborative aspect for anyone who participates. Players start by joining the discord server asociated with the game, and downloading the game client. Once downloaded, they set up their account and gain access to the rest of the server. For each area they enter, they will be able to see the discord channel/social area asocated with that area, and communicate with other players to coordinate a collaboration to make it through the area. The game is centered around the idea that no single person can easily make it through the dungeon/levels (although it's theoretically possible with enough practice). The story progresses across the whole server giving extra rewards and rankings to those who spend the most time in the game and unlocking more areas and lore. The most active areas will be streamed to a viewing channel in the discord server for non-participants to see. Events will also occur in the discord server in which everyone who can use text chat can participate.

### Lore
It is the start of the 22nd century, and archaeologists have uncovered an ancient tomb of unfathomable size extending deep into the crust of the earth. The world powers have called upon anyone willing to journey into its depths to recover artifacts of the ancient world. Who knows what the depths of the ancient dungeon may hold, and what power might be achievable from collecting what lies within.

# Installation
Download the zip from the latest version, and run the contained .exe application after unzipping in the install folder of your choice. Alternatively, you can use the Git implementation of your choice to open a branch and run in an IDE.
